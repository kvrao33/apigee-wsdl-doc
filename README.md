**Installation and Setup:**

1. Clone the Repository and Navigate to "wsdl2apigee":
   - Use this command to clone the repository and enter the "wsdl2apigee" directory:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/apigee/wsdl2apigee.git
     cd wsdl2apigee
     ```

2. Install Maven:
   - Open the "wsdl2apigee" folder in your terminal.
   - Install Maven with this command:
     ```
     mvn install
     ```

3. Set Up the WSDL:
   - If the `.m2` folder is hidden, press `Ctrl+H` to reveal it.
   - Open the `.m2` folder, then navigate to the "repository" folder.
   - Inside "repository," open the "wsdl2apigee" folder.
   - Go into the "1.0.0" folder.

4. Run the Command:
   - To generate the API, execute this command with your WSDL URL (replace `<wsdl URL or Path>` with the client's provided URL):
     ```
     java -jar wsdl2apigee-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -wsdl=<wsdl URL or Path>
     ```

   - If you have a local WSDL file (e.g., `filename.wsdl`), provide the path directly:
     ```
     java -jar wsdl2apigee-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar -wsdl=/path/to/your/filename.wsdl
     ```

5. Create a Zip File:
   - After running the command, a zip file will be generated inside the "1.0.0" folder.

6. Upload to Apigee:
   - Upload the generated zip folder/bundle directly to Apigee, and you can rename it as needed.
